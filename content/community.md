        <p>Initially in the KIWI community you are going to find many like minded community members that have various technical skills to help advance things along while Adam concentrates on the bigger picture.  Mostly,  web developers, programers and some pretty talented hobbyists are available to assist with mining set-up, overall guideance, etc.</p>
        <p>But eventually you'll start seeing more and more members like myself that don't have the technical skills, but are willing to learn about the projects being worked on to help spread the word.  In the chat I don't have much to contribute, so I stay on the sidelines, but that doesn't matter because I am learning a lot as I read through the different channels.</p>
        <p>It's not at all a tough crowd, so I think I'll stay for awhile and as long as the community is willing to have me around.  They are mostly forgiving, so that should be for quite some time.</p>

        <p>Joey here, better known as silvioj in the KIWI discord chat. Started in the crypto world quite late, but have developed a strong passion for all things crypto. I see the endless possibilities decentralization, and blockchain technologies offer.</p>
        <p>37 years old, I have a basic 2-year degree in programming (years ago), run a small web design and marketing company, and also work full time at Ford.</p>
        <p>The KIWI project to me is all about community and passion for technology, the possibilities are endless where this token can end up. I’m happy to come for the ride and contribute wherever I can to help give this token a bright future. There’s no doubt you will not find a more open, and caring community.</p>
